# Debugging-React-Apps  
## Day 24  
The topic of this segment is how to debug mya apps and learn to recognize errors and fixing them. With the following example i can clearly see that i have many tools that can help me identify and pinpoint where a mistake may be found. It can appear on the screen of the local server and more importantly VS Code has many ways of showing me where the mistake is made. After looking at the line of the code from where the problem comes and the explanation of the error in my terminal i can fix it easily if i pay attention. A first example is sth like this  ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/164035876-08576291-d0a6-4d20-b719-6a8b56d9bf2d.png)  
Another category of errors is that of a code flaw warnings. My new app if i observe it closely i can see that when i am making new entries and i try to delete them, they are not deleted when i click them, instead it deletes the first one i added. This is an error that does not appear on the screen nor it is a compiling problem. This is a logican mistake and i can narrow it down by analyzing the chain of events that led me to it. Another usefull information here is the error that appears on my console of developer tools like this ![Screenshot_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/164042022-2c9bde9b-94e5-44c2-a3af-1dff08a2ed3a.png)  
One more way of understanding how to find errors is working with breakpoints from the developer tools on my browser. If i click on sources and find my source files i can manipulate the function calls, stop to some points on where i think its the error and then resume my code again like this ![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/164045224-dd3f2bfe-f6cb-40f6-b67e-bf15681124cb.png)  
The last tool i can use in debugging is the React Dev Tools. After installing it on chrome i can see that 2 more components have beed added to my dev tools which are components and profiler. The component item is really usefull since i can view my code and how it is represented on my browser and manipulate it ![Screenshot_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/164047232-64b189c0-52a4-4f7e-9faa-c46edec13e5b.png)  
## Day 25  
After some weeks off the project i focused on getting assesments for LinkedIn in JavaScript, HTML, Css and React itself. After successfully achieving good scores i will be focusing on the project again in order to finish it.  ![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/169891555-1752142f-3b1e-4f56-9cca-0e18369aa925.png)
